# Onekocord: Oneko for Discord!

Oneko, the internet cat, implemented into Discord wherever you wish! 
Hosted here are skins and code snippets for Oneko that should be compatible for all web based clients (Vencord, Betterdiscord, etc.)

## Installation

To install Onekocord, open [this file](https://github.com/onekocord/onekocord/blob/main/onekocord.theme.css) and **EITHER** copy the links from all lines starting with @import and add them as Online themes **OR** copy all contents of the file to the top of your QuickCSS/CustomCSS file.

TODO: clarification and links on how to open those

## Animations

Valid animations are:
  - alert
  - runright
  - runleft
  - scratchright
  - scratchleft
  - scratchdown
  - scratchup
  - spinleft
  - spinright
  - sleep (EXPERIMENTAL)
  - wakeup (EXPERIMENTAL)
  - gotosleep (EXPERIMENTAL)

Experimental animations are technically valid animations, though they might not work as expected.

## Skins

Valid Skins are all the files in the Onekoskins folder, just change default.png in the default variables to whichever you want!
